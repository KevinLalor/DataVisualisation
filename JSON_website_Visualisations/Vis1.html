                  generosity and perceptions of corruption.</p>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">This scatterplot shows the relationship between the healthy life expectancy and GDP per capita of a country.
               Each point represents a country and these are coloured according to the continent the country is in. Hovering over these points will show you
               the name of the country the point represents and the actual number of its healthy life expectancy and GDP per capita. Clicking on a continent
               in the legend will highlight all the countries in that continent and lower the opacity of the other points that belong to the other continents.</td>

            <tr>
               <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
               <td style="vertical-align: top;">There is a clear correlation between healty life expectancy and GDP per capita. In general, countries and continents
               we expect to be healthier and richer tend to be higher up (first world countires), while third world countries tend to be towards the bottom-left.
               Surprisingly, when we filter the continents we see some countries in continents we expect to be poorer and less healthy such as Africa doing quite well,
               and the contrast is seen in continents we expect to do well such as Europe, where we have some countries not doing so well. By far the most spaced out 
               continent is Asia.
               <p>There is one extreme outlier in the dataset with a zero for healthy life expectancy. This would seem to be an error in the dataset in which the
                  country didn't send in that list of data, and which passed my filter as it had a GDP per capita value. We can see that this country is Swaziland
                  when we hover over the data point.
               </p>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
               <td style="vertical-align: top;">To display the relationship between two quantitative variables, I decided that a scatterplot would be effective.
               This takes advantage of people's ability to percieve variation on the horizontal and vertical axis. I used a standard color scheme from the vega-lite
               library called, "category 10" as I knew I only needed a few strong colours to represent the continents. I also added a tooltip for country name,
               healthy life expectancy, and GDP per capita for each data point.
            
               <p>The chart didn't ditinguish between the countries very well so I looked into solutions. One solution I found was to change the size of the points
                  based on popluation. However, the dataset didn't have this information, also, I wanted the graph to focus on the trend in every country, and not to 
                  focus on the name or perception of countries based on size or popluation.
                  Another issue was overplotting. To combat this I changed the opacity levels to make it easier to identify different points. I also added an interactive
                  legend, this allows you to focus on one continent by changing the opacity of the other points belonging to other continents to 0.2. This was a good solution
                  as I wanted to keep the same graph as other didn't portray my data as well i.e. bar charts / heatmaps.
