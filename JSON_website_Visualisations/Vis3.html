               <p>This data set contains the World Happiness Ranking, I have also added the Continent to which all the countries belong too. 
                  Other information provided include country name, Score, GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices,
                  generosity and perceptions of corruption.</p>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">How does GDP per capita and Healty life expectancy vary between countries and Continents? 
               What is the relationship between these two attributes? How do the other attributes affect happiness score and overall ranking? Is there trends in attributes in certain continents?</td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;">These two strip charts show the GDP per capita and happiness score of countries in different continents. Each mark represents an individual
              country, darker marks indicate multiple countries at that score or GDP rating stacked on eachother. The red dot represents the mean GDP and happiness score respectfully.
              Hovering over a mark will give you the name of the country the mark represents, it's GDP and happiness score.</td>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
               <td style="vertical-align: top;">The charts are quite spread out for both score and GDP within the continents. The continents have quite a difference between the best
                and worst country in terms of happiness and GDP. We see Oceania having only two values as the dataset only included New Zealand and Australia and not other countries and 
                regions in Oceania.
               <p>
                We also see close clumps of countries, these countries seem to be ones close to eachother or ones with shared culture such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, or the 
                Nordics, although this is not always true.
               </p>

               <td style="vertical-align: top;"><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
               <td style="vertical-align: top;">I used strip charts as positions along a common axis is an effective way of conveying quantitative data. By grouping countires according
                to the the continent they're in and sorting according to average score and GDP we can see trends that exist in cultures in those continents. This obvious when we look at
                Oceania or Europe for example. It also lets us see outliers in these continents and we can begin to ask why this is the case.
               <p>
                Issues with this plot is that it suffers from overplotting. I reduced this issue by knowing my dataset well (only 156 countires overall), and by setting opacity to 0.3,
                so the marks that are darker blue indicate multiple countries at the same value. This adds some limitation as you can not identify every country by hovering over the marks
                if they are on top of eachother but, the trends I want to show are still apparent.                  
               </p>
               <p>
                Alternative plots of distribution such as, box plots or histograms, could make a similar point but with only a limited amount of continents and only one hundred and fifty six
                countries they wouldn't be as effective. Another tool to deal with overplotting is binning. Binning wouldn't work with my visualisation as I'm using continents on the Y-Axis.
                This would mean every country of one continent would fall into a single bin.
